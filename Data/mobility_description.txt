The data is about economic mobility. The data come from a large study based on tax records, which allowed
researchers to link the income of adults to the income of their parents several decades previously. For privacy
reasons, we don’t have individual-level data, but we do have aggregate statistics about economic mobility
for several hundred communities, containing most of the American population, and covariate information
about those communities. We are interested in predicting economic mobility from the characteristics of
communities.
The data file
www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/=stat401/mobility.csv
has information on 729 communities. The variable we want to predict is economic mobility; the rest are
potential predictor variables (covariates). 


The variables are:
1. Mobility: The probability that a child born in 1980–1982 into the lowest quintile (20%) of household
income will be in the top quintile at age 30. Individuals are assigned to the community they grew up
in, not the one they were in as adults.
2. Commute: Fraction of workers with a commute of less than 15 minutes.
3. Longitude: Geographic longitude for the center of the community.
4. Latitude. Geographic latitude for the center of the community.
5. Name: the name of principal city or town.
6. State: the state of the principal city or town of the community.
The Research Question. The researchers who gathered this data want to know if short commuting times
lead to higher rates of social mobility. (For a project in regression class.)
