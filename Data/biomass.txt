X1 = salinity ◦/◦◦(SALINITY )
X2 = acidity as measured in water (pH )
X3 = potassium ppm (K)
X4 = sodium ppm (Na)
X5 = zinc ppm (Zn).
The dependent variable Y is aerial biomass gm−2.

The data considered are part of a larger study conducted by Dr. Rick
Linthurst (1979) at North Carolina State University as his Ph.D. thesis
research. The purpose of his research was to identify the important soil
characteristics influencing aerial biomass production of the marsh grass
Spartina alterniflora in the Cape Fear Estuary of North Carolina.
One phase of Linthurst’s research consisted of sampling three types of Design
162 5. CASE STUDY: FIVE INDEPENDENT VARIABLES
Spartina vegetation (revegetated “dead” areas, “short” Spartina areas, and
“tall” Spartina areas) in each of three locations (Oak Island, Smith Island,
and Snows Marsh). Samples of the soil substrate from 5 random sites within
each location–vegetation type (giving 45 total samples) were analyzed for
14 soil physicochemical characteristics each month for several months. In
addition, above-ground biomass at each sample site was measured each
month. The data used in this case study involve only the September sampling
and these five substrate measurements:
