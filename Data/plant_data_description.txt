The first row has the variable names. 

The variables are:
Variable Name Description
NR Native plant species richness
Area area in hectares
Latitude latitude in degrees North Lat
Elev elevation in meters above sea level
Dist distance from mainland in km
Soil number of soil types
Years years since isolation
Deglac years since deglaciation
Human.pop human population
 
The main outcome is native plant species richness, the count of the number of different plant
species.

There are several research questions and goals:
(1) The investigator hypothesizes that native species richness (NR) can be predicted from Area,
Latitude, Elev, Dist, Soil, Years, Deglac, Human.pop.
(2) The investigator hypothesizes that the most important predictors are Area, Elevation and Soil
types.
(3) The investigator hypothesizes that better models will be obtained if a log transformation is
applied to each covariate.
The study was inspired by the following article:
McMaster, Robert T. "Factors influencing vascular plant diversity on
22 islands off the coast of eastern North America." Journal of
Biogeography 32.3 (2005): 475-492.
Your are welcome to track down and read this article if you wish. However, I donâ€™t recommend
it. We are using a completely different dataset. His analysis of his data might lead you towards an
analysis that does not work well for our data.
